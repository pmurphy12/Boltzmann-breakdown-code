# Boltzmann-breakdown-code
Code for numerical simulations from the paper "Breakdown of Boltzmann-type Models for the Alignment of Self-propelled Rods". The code consists of two main parts. The first is code for solving the analytical system using finite differences, while the second is for  agent-based simulations of the underlying physical system.
